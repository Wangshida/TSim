Trajectory & Sensor Simulation Toolkit
======================================

This Matlab library was created to design known stimulus and expected response data files for simulations of IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units) and and MARGS (Magnetic, Angular Rate and Gravity Sensors).  Virtual objects can be moved in X, Y and Z and rotated in roll, pitch and yaw versus time.  It's easy to specify trajectories using a variety of methods.  The Freescale Sensors division used this tool during early days development of their sensor fusion library, and continue to use it for characterization purposes.  The hope is that the sensor community will use it to define standard trajectories for characterization and test purposes.
